PS C:\Users\chama\TP3> vagrant init generic/ubuntu2204 --box-version 4.3.12
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
